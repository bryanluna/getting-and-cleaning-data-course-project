# getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project
This is my repo that I will submit to the Coursera Data Science Specialization - Getting and Cleaning Data final assignment.

The script run_analysis.R is a code that pulls data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository experiment "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set"

Information from the study can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The data set pulled into the formula can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 

After running the script, the code will  create a '.txt file' called 'tidydata.txt' which is a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additional information regarding the the variables, the data, and data cleaning transformations can be found in the file 'CodeBook.md'.
